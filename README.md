# Metamask-Selenium-Auto-Import-Mnemonic
`chrome.py` and `edge.py` are main script. You can choose either script to run if you have installed both browser.

`MetaMask_Chrome.crx` and `MetaMask_Edge.crx` are Metamask extension download from Chrome Web Store and Edge Web Store, modified one line code. [Why modify?](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat/pull/360#issuecomment-1547271080)

You can download the Metamask extension using [CRX Extractor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crx-extractordownloader/ajkhmmldknmfjnmeedkbkkojgobmljda) and modify the extension by yourself if you don't trust this crx file.

`chromedriver.exe` and `msedgedriver.exe` are browser driver.

I use `Edge 116.0.1938.69` and `Chrome 116.0.5845.180`.

If you use different version of Edge or Chrome, download the following driver version by yourself and replace `msedgedriver.exe` or `chromedriver.exe` with it.

[Download chromedriver (version <= 115)](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) | [Download chromedriver (version >= 116)](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) | [Download msedgedriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
